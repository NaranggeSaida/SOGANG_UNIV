To prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} n^{1/n} = 1$, we can use the following steps:

First, we will show that $n^{1/n} \geq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

Consider the function $f(x) = x^{1/x}$ for $x > 0$. We can take the logarithm of $f(x)$ and rewrite it as:

$\ln(f(x)) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x}$

Taking the derivative of $\ln(f(x))$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$\ln'(f(x)) = \frac{1-\ln(x)}{x^2}$

Notice that $\ln'(f(x))$ is negative for $x > e$, since $\ln(x) > 1$ for $x > e$. Therefore, $\ln(f(x))$ is a decreasing function for $x > e$, and we have:

$\ln(f(x)) \leq \ln(f(e)) = \frac{1}{e}$

Exponentiating both sides, we get:

$f(x) \leq e^{1/e}$

In particular, $n^{1/n} \leq e^{1/e}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore, $n^{1/n}$ is bounded above by a constant, and hence it is a bounded sequence.

Next, we will show that $n^{1/n}$ is a monotonically decreasing sequence for $n \geq 3$:

Taking the logarithm of the ratio of consecutive terms, we get:

$\ln\left(\frac{n^{1/n}}{(n-1)^{1/(n-1)}}\right) = \frac{\ln(n) - \ln(n-1)}{n\ln(n-1)}$

Let $f(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x}$ for $x > 1$. Taking the derivative of $f(x)$, we get:

$f'(x) = \frac{1-\ln(x)}{x^2}$

Notice that $f'(x)$ is negative for $x > e$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is a decreasing function for $x > e$, and we have:

$f(n) \leq f(n-1)$

This implies that $\frac{\ln(n)}{n} \leq \frac{\ln(n-1)}{n-1}$, or equivalently, $\ln(n) - \ln(n-1) \leq \frac{\ln(n-1)}{n-1} - \frac{\ln(n)}{n}$. Therefore, we have:

$\ln\left(\frac{n^{1/n}}{(n-1)^{1/(n-1)}}\right) \leq 0$

This shows that $n^{1/n}$ is a monotonically decreasing sequence for $n \geq 3$.

Now, let us consider the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} n^{1/n}$. Since $n^{1/n}$ is a bounded and monotonically decreasing sequence, it must converge to some limit $L$. Letting $n \to \infty$ in the inequality $n^{1/n} \leq e^{1/e}$, we get:

$L \leq e^{1/e}$

On the other hand, since $n^{1/n} \geq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $L \geq 1$. Therefore, we have:
